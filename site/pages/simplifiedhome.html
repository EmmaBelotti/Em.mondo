            Hi! I'm Ema (he/him), and this is my world! I'm an italian guy with too many hobbies,
                this site is a sort of cozy/digital museum of all the things that i have done, enjoy your stay!
        </p>

            i love programming! Even if i'm not good enough to hack the gate, <br> i enjoy modding games and doing silly programs. <br>
            A few years ago i joined the Celeste* modding community, and made some of the worst maps and entities
            gamebanana has yet to offer... *(a videogame you MUST play to be my friend)
        </p>
        <b>some stuff i made:</b>

            i also love painting and sculpting silly miniatures. My hands are very shaky, and painting 3d sculptures is way easier for me than drawing 2d images! <br>
            those three are called bugman, corpse snatcher and longface. 
            They were my first sculpture, kitbash (a mix of toys, epoxy resin and random things glued together) and mold/cast, respectively. <br>
            every cryptid has its own story and quirks, click <a href="minis.html">HERE</a> to discover the other ones! <br>
            <i> i'm not really trying to sell them, but if you really like one contact me and i'll see what i can do...</i> <br>
            <i>...or if you want to be lore dumped, that's cool too! feel free to use them in your adventures!</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            as i said before, i'm not very good at drawing, but it's fun, so who cares! I use a One by Wacom to access the mighty power of the ctrl-z,
                    else i would be forced to repeat my mistakes over and over again... <br>
                    i like to draw stylized eyes with too many decorations, bones and skulls... <br>
                    if you want to see the rest of my drawings, click <a href="art.html">HERE</a> <br>
                    btw, this cat isn't mine, one day i just stumbled upon it, lost a staring contest (it was so menacing!), fell in love and decided to draw it as penance... <br>
