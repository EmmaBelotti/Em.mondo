        <!--article-->
        <p>
            Sculpting a mini is <i>"a bit harder"</i> than kitbashing one, but you will be able to create <i><s style="color: gainsboro;">almost</s></i> anything you want!
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">what you'll need:</h2>
        <i>
            <ul>
                <li>Polymer clay or other sculpting materials [better if soft (easier to use but less precise) ]</li>
                <li>Aluminium foil to not waste all your polymer clay on your first thingo</li>
                <li>Armature wire</li>
                <li>A pointy stick or smt solid to sculpt with</li>
                <li>(Optional but suggested) silicone sculpting tools</li>
                <li>An oven</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Baking paper or whatever it's called so the clay doesnt stick on your table</li>
                <li>(Optional) isopropyl alcohol and a brush</li>
                <li>(Optional) epoxy resin (milliput, green stuff...)</li>
                <li>(Optional) exacto knife (as a sculpting tool) and nippers</li>
            </ul>
        </i>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Step 1): plan stuff</h2>
        <img src="../../file/img/article/diysculpt/step1.jpg" class="articleimg">
        <i style="color: gainsboro; text-align: center;">Heavily inspired by spirited away, this design was too chaotic and complicated...</i> <br>
        <span>
            This ain't kitbashing! Planning your mini before sculpting it is very important! Even if you can't draw, i recommended sketching the front and one side of your miniature, so you'll be able to reference them later! <br>
            <span style="background-color: antiquewhite; color: green; border-radius: 0.1em; padding: 0 0.5em;"> > BuT EmA, i'm not creative enough to create a monster out of thin air! </span> 
            <br>
            DW! You can be inspired by other artists, or websites like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Printerest</a>, just don't copy-paste someone else's stuff!
        </span>



        
        <h2 style="font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Step 2): armor up!</h2>
        <img src="../../file/img/article/diysculpt/step2.jpg" class="articleimg">
        <i style="color: gainsboro; text-align: center;">I cheated for the monster's face, remember to add bits only AFTER you bake everything!</i> <br>
        <span>
            Attach the steel wire on <i style="color: gainsboro;">something</i>, bend it to form a sort of stickman, then bulk it up with some aluminium foil... <br>
            It's sculpting time! Start with rough shapes and silhouettes, then add more details when you feel ready. Remember that you can bake your sculpture multiple times! <br>
            &#9757;&#129299; Don't be afraid to create "save points", if you mess up and add too much clay you'll be able to cut and sand it once it's baked! <br>
            &#9757;&#129299; Before cooking, smooth the sculpture with isopropyl alcohol (don't soak the mini in it), it helps melting the fingerprints! <br>
            &#9757;&#129299; For the mega-small stuff, you can use epoxy resin after everything else is done!

        </span>

        <h2 style="font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Step 3): draw the rest of the fucking howl!</h2>
        <img src="../../file/img/minis/giftertradergambler.jpg" class="articleimg">
        <i style="color: gainsboro; text-align: center;">Wow those guides SUCK</i> <br>
        After cooking your mini, you can kitbash and sculpt on top of it! 
        In this image you can see that i added the earrings, teeth and decorations later, because it was too hard to sculpt them with fimo. <br>
        Anyways, hope you enjoyed it! Try it and have fun! <br>
        <i style="color: gainsboro;"> (If you are more of a visual learner, i suggest watching "Miscast" on yt, especially the videos where he sculpts his Daemon prince and plague toad)</i>
