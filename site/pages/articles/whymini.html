            <i style="color: gainsboro;">...and why you should try it too!</i>
        </span>
        <!--article-->

        <p>
            while drawing and painting have lower entry barriers (literally a pencil and a <i  style="color: #ffc20e;">surface</i>), miniatures require tools,
            specific paints and materials. Still, i think everyone should try this hobby at least once, because for me it was an eye-opening experience!
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Do i suck at art, or do i suck at <i style="color: pink;">2D</i> art?</h2>

        <p>
            i painted my first mini because <i><s style="color: gainsboro;">i was forced to</s></i>: i had a dnd game scheduled, and too many grey monsters, not ready for the upcoming encounter. <br>
            Before then, i didn't consider myself an <i style="color: orange;">"artsy"</i> person, because my art-related projects were all <b style="color: rgb(255, 99, 99);">failures</b>: I couldn't draw, i couldn't blend colors together or even shade something... <br>
            <b><i style="color: aquamarine;">... well fuck GUESS WHAT? the MEDIUM was the problem! <br></i></b>
            i enjoyed painting those first test models, and the result were <i style="color: burlywood;">decent</i> enough to paint some more!
        </p>
        <span style="text-align: center;">...but this isn't about me, why should <b style="color: aquamarine;"> YOU </b> try miniature painting, even as a non-artist?</span> <br>

        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Your canvas is ready, or you could easily make one!</h2>

        <p>
            drawing is <b style="color: rgb(255, 99, 99);">&#128293;HARD&#128293;</b>! I have two blenders instead of arms and know <b style="color: rgb(255, 99, 99);">NOTHING</b> about anatomy! Painting other people's work is not that fun either, makes me think i'm a toddler drawing with crayons... <br>
            With miniatures, you could buy or 3d-print assembled ones, but also make your owns in less than an afternoon! I made 2 guides where i explain how to, and the results are (imo) megacool! <br>
            also, while sculpting is very hard to master, it's a tactile medium! You can use all the object around you as <i style="color: #ffc20e;">&#127775;free texture&#127775;</i>
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">The third dimension is your friend!</h2>

        <i style="color: gainsboro; text-align: center;">entrapped in a lost temple, this demon lures its preys with the treasures they crave the most...</i> <br>
        <p>
            the main difference between painting a <span style="color: pink;">2D</span> dude and a <span style="color: #ffc20e;">3D</span> model is, you guessed it, the <span style="color: #ffc20e;">EXTRA DIMENSION!</span> <br>
            it sounds like a joke, but there are so many ways to use it to your advantage: you could, for example:
            <i>
                <ul>
                    <li>use a torch in a dark room, to know where to paint the light reflections</li>
                    <li>use watered-down paints (washes) to stain the deepest recesses, to create contrast and dark shadows</li>
                    <li>use a big brush with dried paint to hit only the exposed edges</li>
                </ul>
            </i>
            <span> the canvas <i style="color: plum;">reacts</i> to your brush strokes, and i find it megacool! </span>
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Tactile fun!</h2>
        <img src="../../file/img/minis/VROOOARRRR.jpg" class="articleimg">
        <i style="color: gainsboro; text-align: center;">if only archaeologists were alive during the post-apocalypse!</i> <br>
        <p>
            ...it's like playing with toys, but you can also use toxic stuff, knifes and nippers because you are <i  style="color: pink;">an adult!</i>
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">Storytellers and something more...</h2>
        <img src="../../file/img/minis/bleed_venus_debloon.jpg" class="articleimg">
        <i style="color: gainsboro; text-align: center;">born by a sin, those creatures contain profecies not yet fulfilled...</i> <br>
        <p>
            i try to give a name to every monster i make, and a reason for them to exist in this world. Their stories come up naturally, 
            and meeting them in a roleplaying campaign feels x10 times more interesting than fighting a bunch of <i  style="color: greenyellow;">goblins</i> or <i  style="color: pink;">human warriors</i>... <br>
            but some of them have a <span style="color: plum;">deeper meening</span>: when i felt sad or stressed, i always tried to work on one of those creatures. Painting them is so relaxing and therapeutic!
            Having a concrete <span style="color: #ffc20e;">"reward"</span> after feeling hopeless for a while is such a dopamine boost. It's like entrapping all my negative energy on something so small and ugly, that could be
            defeated by a flick of my fingers. It's one of the best feelings in the world, and i can't recommend this hobby enough!
