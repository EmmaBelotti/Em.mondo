        <!--article-->

        <i style="color:gainsboro;">...This guide is not made for people who have no idea what yu-gi-oh is!</i>
        <p>
            I &#128150; cardgames! I have played <span style="color:#ffc20e;">Heartstone</span>, <span style="color:rgb(0, 162, 255);">Legends of Runeterra</span>, <span style="color:#ffc20e;">Stormbound</span> and <span style="color:violet;">Marvel snap</span> in the past, but only one of them took a special spot in my heart. <br>
            it's <span style="color:orange;">Yu-gi-oh!</span> it has an &#10071; in the name! No mana or boring resources!!! No set-rotation!!! It's <span style="color:orange;">AMAZING</span>!!!!! <br>
            <i style="color: gainsboro;">...In theory, at least...</i> not having multiple formats means optimized decks and power creeping are some of it's biggest downsides. <span style="color:orange;">Modern Ygo</span> rounds last max <b  style="color: rgb(233, 83, 83);">3 turns</b>,
            every deck is a huge floodgate or a combo, and famous cards from the past are too slow for a game that is getting faster and faster.
            the entry barrier is insane, and most players give up after 2/3 matches. But does it have to be this way?
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">The drafting format... <i style="color: gainsboro;">sucks...</i></h2>
        <p>

            
            Modern Yu-gi-oh! Is an <span style="color:#ffc20e;"> Archetype-centric</span> game, that means cards only work with ones with similar names. For example, if you open a <span style="color:violet;">"Blackwing"</span> card in a pack,
            but you don't have any other <span style="color:violet;">"Blackwing"</span>s, then that card doesn't do anything, that's why drafting is not a popular format... 
            <br>
            ...but what about <b style="color:#ffc20e;">&#9209;CUBE DRAFTING&#9209;</b>??? Let's steal ideas from our <span style="color:rgb(82, 182, 240);">Magic the gathering</span> friends! <br> <br>
            <span style="background-color: antiquewhite; color: green; border-radius: 0.1em; padding: 0 0.5em;"> > Ema, what the fuck is a cube? </span> <br>
            glad you asked, <s style="color:gainsboro;">imaginary reader!</s> A cube is a collection of cards <b style="color:pink;">YOU</b> select to open packs from. You don't actually have to buy stuff every time
            you want to draft a deck, just pick some cards upside down from the cube and that's your pack! <br>

            <br>

        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">What are the pros of cube drafting?</h2>
        <i>
            <ul>
                <li>No useless cards in a pack, you can add whatever (strong or trash) cards you like!</li>
                
                <li>Drafting actually test your deck building skills, <s style="color: gainsboro;">picking decks from the net doesnt</s></li>
                <li>Slows down the game, simplifies it by removing meta-threats, makes it more balanced</li>
                <li>Every cube is unique and ever-changing! You can add banned cards, custom cards, house rules, the sky is the limit!</li>
                <li>You can add only certain types of cards (only fusions, synchros...) if you don't like other ones (<s style="color: rgba(143, 255, 109, 0.836);">fuck pendulums</s>)</li>
                <li>Drafting is <b style="color: rgb(233, 83, 83);">"fun"</b>! Picking cards your friends needed to complete their decks (<b style="color: orange;">hate drafting</b>) is <b style="color: rgb(233, 83, 83);">"fun"</b>!!!</li>
                <li>A whole cube can easily be cheaper than a single meta deck lol</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">How to make a ygo cube:</h2>
        <i>
            <ul>
                <li>For a beginner, i suggest making a 360-500 cards cube. The more cards you'll add, the less consistent the decks will be (i try to keep ~460 cards in mine)</li>
                <li>You can make a cube where there's a single copy of every card (<span style="color:#ffc20e;">singleton</span>), or multiple copies. The more you add, the more common it becomes!</li>
                <li>Decide which <b style="color: rgb(233, 83, 83);">house rules</b> your cube has! I don't use them, but some people like the <span style="color:violet;">"all monsters are all types / attributes / names"</span>  rules</li>
                <li>Pick cards already in your collection, buy bulks, or the cheapest cards you can find! <i style="color: gainsboro;">(You can also use proxies or printed cards)</i></li>
                <li>Non-meme cards should fit a role, they can be: recruiters/searchers, removal, floodgates, win conditions, beatsticks or support (draw, recycle cards...)</li>
                <li>Don't use brain fart cards like <i style="color:violet;">lord of the heavenly prison</i>, each player should be able to read a pack of 10-15 cards in max. 5 mins </li>
                <li>You can use generic cards and type / attribute supports, or specific archetypes, if you include multiple copies of them</li>
                <li>If some cards rely on other ones, i suggest giving the other cards after the draft (for example, <span style="color:orange;">Exodia</span>'s pieces, or <span style="color:burlywood;">Destiny hero - Malicius</span> copies)</li>
                <li>Also, if you are use <i style="color:violet;">fusions</i> and <span style="color:rgb(0, 162, 255);">Rituals</span>, consider giving x3 copies of <span style="color:rgba(143, 255, 109, 0.836);">polymerization</span> and the <span style="color:rgba(143, 255, 109, 0.836);">ritual spells</span> after the draft</li>
                <li>Draft the extra deck after the main one <i style="color: gainsboro;">(for beginners i suggest building a cube with no extra deck cards first)</i></li>
                <li>If you want to include archetype-specific cards, or memes, in a strong, generic-cards-only cube, you can <b style="color: rgb(233, 83, 83);">buff/nerf/rework</b> their effects with <span style="color:#ffc20e;">post-its</span>!</li>
                <li>Don't include turbo-broken cards like <b style="color: rgb(233, 83, 83);">sixth-sense</b>, but banned cards are cool and fun!</li>
            </ul>
        </i>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">How to draft:</h2>
        <i>
            <ul>
                <li>Every player picks 15 cards from the cube upside down, chooses one and pass the rest to the player to the left</li>
                <li>Repeat 3 times for 30-45 cards decks, or 4 times for 40-60 cards decks <br>
                (30 cards deck are consistent and better for a singleton format, drafting 4 packs might end up in op decks, if that's what you like)
                </li>
                <li>You can show some of the cards drafted (for example, the first in every pack) and enable card trades to make things spicier</li>
                <li>Play yu-gi-oh with your temporary decks <s  style="color: gainsboro;">until someone passes out!</s></li>
            </ul>
        </i>
        <h2 style="margin: 0%; font-family: Lugrasimo, Verdana;">my cube</h2>
        <p>
            You can find my cube <a href="https://ygoprodeck.com/cube/view-cube/5709" target="_blank">HERE</a>, i wanted to include cards i like (<i style="color:violet;">&#128150;Yajiro Invader&#128150;</i>), cards from the past i used as a kid and modern stuff to make it not boring to play, in a singleton format.
            I use no archetype-specific cards, but type and attribute supports, that are a bit more flexible and forgiving. 
            You can pick whatever cards you like, i recommend saving your cube on <a href="https://ygoprodeck.com/cube/" target="_blank">YGOPRODECK</a> so you can test-draft it online (and maybe play some rounds on <a href="https://www.duelingbook.com" target="_blank">DUELLING BOOK</a>)
